# React Native Workshop - ReactJSAcademy

## Setup

```
git clone <REPO>
cd react-native-workshop
yarn install
# or
npm install
```

## Run your project

There are Two major ways to run yout Expo projects locally: using EXP, or running it in your Simulator (Xcode or Android Studio, Genymotion...). I recommend installing exp in your cli and login into your account in order to run your project directly into your phone.

### using Expo CLI

```bash
yarn add global expo-cli
# or

npm i -g expo-cli
expo init MY_PROJECT_NAME
cd MY_PROJECT_NAME
expo start
```

This will start the Bundler for the app and enables the app for visualization at your phone. Now you only need to go to your phone to the `Projects` tab and Voila!, there it is!!

Happy Coding!

## Excersice

### Foundation

- Go to [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io) and create a Screen from Scratch. we recommend you to create the Login Screen. You can start coding from this [base Starter](@leanjscom/foundation-starter-example)
- clone this repo and copy and paste your LoginScreen to use it.
- fix the `TOCScreen` (`scr/Auth/Screens/TOCScreen`) so the user can see the whole content. you need to add something in order for the screen to scroll.
- go to `src/Timeline/Screens/TimelineNavigator` and complete the Navigator Implementation.


### Navigation

- go to `src/App/Screens/Navigator.js` and create a `SwitchNavigator`. Follow the instructions in the file.
- in `src/App/Screens/PrivateNavigator`, finish the implementation of the TabNavigator.
- in `src/Auth/Screens/LoginScreen` implement a navigation to the PRIVATE_SCREEN
- go to `src/Timeline/Components/TweetDetail.js`. Whenever the user press on top of the header, you need to navigate to the Profile View of that tweet's user. Hint: you are getting a method that you need to call onPress of that header. can you add an `onPress` prop directly to the header ???

### Animations

- Go to [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io) and create a simple animation of a circle that changes the scale on `componentDidMount`.
- Now trigger the animation whenever the user Presses the circle.
- go to `src/Timeline/Screens/ProfileScreen` and animate the header onScroll. follow the instructions in the file.
